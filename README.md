# Library management relational database application

## Requirements 
You are required to design and implement an Oracle  application that satisfies these requirements. This includes setting up a database schema and providing access methods to this in the form of queries and views. The steps for doing this include: 
- Creating a conceptual schema in the form of an ER or UML diagram. 
- Deriving a relational schema from the ER diagram. 
- Normalising the data to 3rd Normal Form. 
-Implementing this schema by using SQL in Oracle. 
- Populating the database with data. This data should be significant, i.e. 6-9 records per table, but manageable. 2 or 3 records per table. 
- Defining specialised views which are appropriate to various sub-groups of users. 
- Defining SQL queries which could be used as canned queries for naive users.
